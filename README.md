# Rust LTspice parser
A litte parser programm for the raw Files of LTspice IV

This is just a simple program written in Rust, that reads a whole .raw file generated by LTSpice. 
This can be used to do some calculations on the data. I used it to implement a fitness function for several steps of a simulation.

This project is still missing documentation.

There is a file describing [the informations about the raw File, which I gained while programming this](https://github.com/Tyde/rust_ltspice_parser/blob/master/LTSpice_RAW_File_Info.md).

This program currently can only decode .AC Simulations without .fastaccess

You can retrieve the results by using the SteppedSimulation struct:
```rust
let results = SteppedSimulation::from_files("Draft2.raw","Draft2.log");
```
As you can see, this parser needs both the *.raw file and the *.log file generated by LTspice

The SteppedSimulation struct offers several methods to get informations about the simulation.

###Example
```rust

use ltspice_parse::SteppedSimulation;
use ltspice_parse::results::{PeakType,DataType};

main() {
	//Read results
	let results = SteppedSimulation::from_files("Draft2.raw","Draft2.log");
	//Get all Variables that are in the Results of the Simulation
	let vars = results.available_variables();
	//Get all Steps of this simulation
	let steps = results.available_steps();
	//Get a Variable with its results. This will get the frequency, because it is the first variable
	let freq = results.get_values_for_variable_at(&steps[0],&vars[0]).unwrap();
	//Get the variable struct for the node with the name vout
	let vout = results.get_variable_for_name("V(vout)").unwrap();
	
	//Find steps, which have a resonance arount a point. This is very rudimentary
	let resonances = results.find_with_resonance_at(&vout,955.0);
	
	//Evaluate a fitness function over all steps. The fitness function is defined in the struct implementation
	// The return value is a Tuple with the fitness value and the VariableResult
	let mut fit = results.calculate_fitnesses(&vout);
	//Get the values of the vout variable
	let values = results.get_values_for_variable_at(&vout,&vout).unwrap();
	//Plot the values with gnuplot
	values.plot(&freq,&mut fg,&format!("Fitness: {}",bundle[k].1),colors[k]);
}
```
